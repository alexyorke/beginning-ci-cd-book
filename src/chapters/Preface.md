Thanks for reviewing my book!

What I am looking for:

-   Sections that should be removed (have no relevance to the book at all), added, or are debatable (provide a case study or references.)

-   What sections you\'d like me to write more about, what sections are neutral, and what sections are boring.

-   High-level overview of any organization changes. For example, rearranging the sections in the table of contents.

-   Technical inaccuracies (when possible.)

-   Changing the table of contents to better align with the audience.

-   Whether you would recommend this book to your friends (I promise I won't hold you to it.)

-   Whether the current table of contents may be sufficient to meet the page count goal, or I may need to write more about other sections.

What I am not looking for as much:

-   Spelling, grammar, or formatting.

-   Nit-picks.

| \* \*\*Types of tests vary by team and resource:\*\* While developers should handle unit tests, the responsibility for integration, system, and user acceptance testing can depend on team structure and the presence of dedicated testers or QA. Some teams may have specialized testers (like cameramen for cinema cameras), while others rely entirely on developers. |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Collaboration is key:\*\* Even with dedicated testers, developers should collaborate closely with them to ensure tests are effective and cover requirements, not just implementation details.                                                                                                                                                                     |

| \* \*\*Testing provides multiple benefits:\*\* Tests not only verify functionality but also serve as documentation and examples for how to use the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Team dynamics should influence test strategy:\*\* Teams should leverage individual strengths and interests. If some developers enjoy integration testing, they should be empowered to do it. If others excel at process adherence and verification, they should focus on those areas.                                                                             |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Context matters:\*\* Larger organizations might have different testing needs compared to smaller ones. Product complexity (e.g., mechanical parts alongside software) also impacts testing strategies.                                                                                                                                                            |

| In essence, developers should own the quality of their work through testing, utilizing TDD where possible, and collaborating effectively with other team members who contribute to the overall testing effort. Avoiding the \"over the fence\" mentality is crucial for successful product development.                                                                  |

| \* \*\*Automated testing is key:\*\* Robust automated tests are essential for effective CI/CD, and the language choice (e.g., Rust) can influence this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Parallel testing improves speed:\*\* Running tests in parallel, as offered by some CI systems, significantly reduces build times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| \* \*\*Maintenance overhead is a factor:\*\* Maintaining self-hosted CI systems and underlying infrastructure can be a burden, leading some teams to favor cloud solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*\"DORA metrics\" as a goal:\*\* Some teams aspire to track and improve DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, Time to Restore Service) as indicators of CI/CD effectiveness.                                                                                                                                             |

| \* \*\*Code reviews are essential:\*\* Not just for catching bugs, but for knowledge transfer, mentoring, shared understanding of the codebase and requirements, and shared ownership. Avoiding soloed knowledge silos is crucial for business continuity and team morale.                                                                                               |

| \* \*\*Focus on design, not minutiae:\*\* Code reviews should prioritize high-level design and architecture discussions. Automated tools should handle code style (braces, indentation, etc.) to avoid \"bikeshedding.\" Review interfaces and module designs \*before\* full implementation.                                                                            |

| \* \*\*Early and often:\*\* Conduct reviews early in the design process and iterate on smaller code chunks. This prevents large, overwhelming reviews and keeps feedback focused and actionable.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Establish a process:\*\* Create checklists for design and code reviews, prioritize review requests (don\'t let them pile up!), and consider a style guide enforced by automated tooling. If conducting synchronous reviews, set a clear agenda.                                                                                                                   |

| \* \*\*Communicate intent:\*\* Before diving into a review, discuss the code\'s purpose (production-ready, experimental, etc.) and the review\'s goals. This ensures everyone is on the same page and avoids misunderstandings.                                                                                                                                          |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Positive framing:\*\* Start reviews by highlighting successes and then offer constructive suggestions. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Shared ownership and mentoring:\*\* Code reviews are opportunities for knowledge transfer and mentoring in both directions (junior ↔ senior). Juniors can offer fresh perspectives and catch errors, while seniors can share their expertise.                                                                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Practicalities:\*\* Aim for daily reviews of small, cohesive code chunks. Pull requests are a useful mechanism, but informal, ad-hoc reviews are also valuable. Establish a routine for handling reviews to avoid bottlenecks.                                                                                                                                    |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Consider pair programming:\*\* For continuous review and collaboration, explore pair or mob programming. While seemingly less efficient in the short term, these practices can improve overall code quality and team performance.                                                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| \* \*\*Metrics:\*\* Don\'t over-index on code review metrics. Focusing on the \*process\* is more valuable, particularly minimizing the waiting time for review feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
