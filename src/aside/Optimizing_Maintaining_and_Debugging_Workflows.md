[Content moved from the draft: workflow design principles; speedups (cache, parallelism, selective execution, fast-fail); cost management (runners, concurrency, timeouts, artifacts, dependabot, scheduling); maintenance/toil reduction; debugging (logs, runner fs, SSH, local `act`, actionlint); advanced topics (webhooks, ChatOps, migrations, open-core).]
