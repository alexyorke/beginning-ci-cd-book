-   **Enabling debug logging:** ([[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging]{.underline}](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging))

-   **BashGuide:** ([[https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide]{.underline}](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide))

### **Techniques** {#techniques .unnumbered}

**1. Local Execution:**

-   Run pipelines on your own hardware or cloud-hosted infrastructure to enable SSH access to the build runner. This allows for comprehensive debugging and inspection of application state.

**2. Bash Script Syntax Checking:**

-   Use bash -n your_script.sh to parse the script without execution, identifying syntax errors like typos or missing brackets.This is especially important because your bashkoff could still have errors and still execute. Only when that line is executed will you see errors.

-   **Important:** Bash scripts continue execution even with errors, only throwing an error upon reaching the faulty line.

**3. Workflow File Linting:**

-   Validate YAML syntax for formatting issues and invisible characters that can cause workflow failures.

-   **Tools:**

    -   **YAML Lint:** Online validator ([[https://www.yamllint.com/]{.underline}](https://www.yamllint.com/)).

    -   **Prettier:** Code formatter for consistent formatting.

-   

-   **UTF-8 Invisibles:** Use a specialized text editor or enable \"show invisibles\" to identify and remove hidden characters.

**4. Debugging \"Exit Code Non-Zero\" Errors:**

-   **GitHub Debug Flag:** Add ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true as a secret in your repository settings for verbose logging.

-   **Pipeline Logs:** Examine logs for error messages generated by failing commands.

-   **Local Replication:** Replicate the runner environment locally to isolate the problem.

-   **Popular Tips:**

    -   **Echo Important Variables:** Add echo statements to print variable values for debugging.

    -   **Use set -e:** Automatically exit the script if any command returns a non-zero exit code, preventing cascading errors.

Here are practical examples based on the topics you\'ve listed:

1\. \*\*Understanding Logging and Error Handling\*\*:

\- \*\*Logging in Bash Scripts\*\*: You can add logging in a bash script using \`echo\` statements. For example, \`echo \"Starting backup at \$(date)\" \>\> backup.log\` logs the start time of a backup operation to a \`backup.log\` file.

\- \*\*GitHub Actions Debugging\*\*: In GitHub Actions, you can enable step debug logging by setting the \`ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG\` secret to \`true\`. This allows you to see detailed debug outputs from your steps.

\- \*\*Verbose Flag\*\*: Using the verbose flag in commands like \`scp\` or \`curl\` can help trace issues. For instance, \`curl -v https://api.example.com\` prints detailed info about the request and response, aiding in debugging HTTP issues.

\- \*\*Isolating Pipeline for Debugging\*\*: If you\'re troubleshooting a CI pipeline, clone it in your CI environment but point it to a non-production or dummy environment. This lets you iterate rapidly without affecting the main application or production data.

2\. \*\*Debugging Bash Scripts\*\*:

\- \*\*Trace with \`-x\`\*\*: Add \`set -x\` at the beginning of your script or run your script with \`bash -x myscript.sh\` to print each command before it is executed, helping trace what\'s happening step-by-step.

\- \*\*Using \`trap\`\*\*: Implement \`trap \'rm -f /tmp/my_temp_file\' EXIT\` to ensure temporary files are cleaned up even if the script exits unexpectedly.

\- \*\*ShellCheck\*\*: Run \`shellcheck myscript.sh\` to find and fix issues in your bash scripts, such as syntax errors or risky command usage.

\- \*\*Redirect Logs\*\*: To handle long outputs, redirect them to a file within your script, e.g., \`./my_script.sh \> script_output.log\` and ensure the log is archived as an artifact in your CI pipeline for later analysis.

3\. \*\*Script Execution and Environment\*\*:

\- \*\*Safe Set Commands\*\*: In a bash script, use \`set -eou pipefail\` to ensure that your script handles errors, unbound variables, and failures in pipelines effectively, stopping execution on the first error encountered.

\- \*\*Validating User Input\*\*: Always validate and sanitize user input in scripts to prevent errors and potential security issues. For example: \`read -p \"Enter your name: \" name; if \[\[ -z \"\$name\" \]\]; then echo \"Name cannot be empty\"; exit 1; fi\`.

5\. \*\*Best Practices and Tools\*\*:

\- \*\*Error Message Analysis\*\*: Use \`agrep\` to analyze error logs, allowing for approximate matches, which can be helpful when dealing with typographical errors in log messages.

\- \*\*Structured Logging\*\*: Implement structured logging using JSON format for logs, which can be easily parsed and analyzed by log management systems. Example: \`echo \'{\"date\":\"\$(date)\",\"level\":\"info\",\"message\":\"Process started\"}\' \>\> app.log\`.

\- \*\*Local CI Environment\*\*: Use tools like Docker to replicate your CI/CD pipeline locally, allowing you to debug issues in an environment that closely mirrors production.

6\. \*\*Miscellaneous Tips\*\*:

\- \*\*Handling Line Endings\*\*: Use \`.gitattributes\` to normalize line endings across different OSes in a collaborative project. Add \`\* text=auto\` to your \`.gitattributes\` to auto-adjust line endings based on your platform.

\- \*\*Script Permissions\*\*: Ensure your scripts have the appropriate permissions by using \`chmod\`, e.g., \`chmod +x myscript.sh\` to make it executable.

\- \*\*Editor Settings\*\*: Configure \`.editorconfig\` to manage common editor settings like indentation style and size, character set, and trimming of trailing whitespace to maintain consistent coding styles among different editors and IDEs used by the team.

### Frequently encountered issues in GitHub actions {#frequently-encountered-issues-in-github-actions .unnumbered}

1\. The most frequently mentioned issues revolve around incorrect setup or use of GitHub actions and workflows, incorrect OS versions in workflows, and unnecessary or wrong job steps in workflows.

2\. The issues with file paths and directories, token and authentication problems, workflow triggers, and versioning and dependency management also appear frequently.

3\. Other frequent issues include problems related to environment variables, typos in variable names or configurations, versions or Docker images in the workflow, and file and directory path errors.

\- \*\*Configuration & Syntax Issues\*\*: This encompasses problems such as incorrect use of actions, incorrect or missing paths, and YAML syntax errors.

\- \*\*Dependency & Versioning Issues\*\*: Workflow failures due to outdated versions of actions/tools, inconsistent versions across environments, or incorrect dependency management commands are common.

\- \*\*Environment & OS Specific Issues\*\*: Problems arising from the workflow being set to run on specific OS versions or not accounting for OS-specific intricacies are notable.

\- \*\*Trigger & Event Issues\*\*: Incorrect or non-optimal setup of when and how the workflows are triggered can lead to inefficiencies or missed execution.

\- \*\*Authentication & Permission Issues\*\*: These are crucial as they can prevent workflows from accessing necessary resources or performing critical tasks, such as pushing to a registry.

Here are intentionally buggy examples for each of the scenarios you mentioned, along with the solutions for the reader to debug. These examples are suitable for inclusion in a teaching material or troubleshooting guide.

\### 1. GitHub Actions and Workflows Issues

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`yaml

name: CI

on: \[push\]

jobs:

build:

runs-on: ubuntu-18.04

steps:

\- uses: actions/checkout@v2

\- name: Set up Python 3.8

uses: actions/setup-python@v2

with:

python-version: \'3.8\'

\- name: Install dependencies

run: pip install -r requirements.txt

\- name: Run tests

run: pytest

\`\`\`

\*\*Buggy Aspects:\*\*

\- Using an outdated Ubuntu version which might not be supported.

\- Implicitly assuming the presence of \`requirements.txt\` and \`pytest\` without ensuring Python package manager (\`pip\`) is up-to-date.

\*\*Solution:\*\*

Update the workflow file:

\- Change \`runs-on: ubuntu-18.04\` to a supported version like \`ubuntu-latest\`.

\- Ensure \`pip\` is upgraded before dependencies are installed:

\`\`\`yaml

\- name: Upgrade pip

run: python -m pip install \--upgrade pip

\- name: Install dependencies

run: pip install -r requirements.txt

\`\`\`

\### 2. File Paths and Dependency Management

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`yaml

on: push

jobs:

build:

runs-on: windows-latest

steps:

\- uses: actions/checkout@v2

\- name: Setup Node.js

uses: actions/setup-node@v2

with:

node-version: \'14\'

\- name: Install dependencies

run: npm install

\- name: Build

run: npm run build

env:

CI: true

\`\`\`

\*\*Buggy Aspects:\*\*

\- Workflow might fail if \`npm run build\` script assumes Unix-style paths but runs on Windows.

\*\*Solution:\*\*

Ensure platform-independent file paths or change \`runs-on\` to a Linux OS if the project requires Unix-based tooling:

\`\`\`yaml

runs-on: ubuntu-latest

\`\`\`

\### 3. Environment Variables and Configuration Errors

\*\*Example:\*\*

\`\`\`yaml

on: push

jobs:

deploy:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps:

\- uses: actions/checkout@v2

\- name: Set up Docker Environment

run: docker login -u \${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} -p \${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

\- name: Build and Push Docker Image

run: \|

docker build -t my-app:\${{ github.sha }} .

docker push my-app:\${{ github.sha }}

\`\`\`

\*\*Buggy Aspects:\*\*

\- Possible typo in Docker image name during push (e.g., missing organization name or incorrect variable use).

\*\*Solution:\*\*

Correct Docker image tags and ensure all environment variables and secrets are correctly spelled and set:

\`\`\`yaml

run: \|

docker build -t myorg/my-app:\${{ github.sha }} .

docker push myorg/my-app:\${{ github.sha }}

\`\`\`

Sure, here are some concrete examples and more technical details for each item in the list:

Missing dependencies: The workflow file does not include all the necessary dependencies, causing the build or tests to fail. For example, if the workflow requires Node.js and npm, the workflow file should include the appropriate actions to set up these tools before running the build or tests.

Example from patch:

arduino

Copy code

\- name: Install dependencies

> run: \|
>
> sudo apt-get update
>
> sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
>
> sudo apt-get install -y npm
>
> Incorrect setup: The workflow file sets up the wrong version of the required tools or packages, causing the build or tests to fail. For example, if the workflow requires a specific version of Node.js, the workflow file should specify that version.
>
> Example from patch:
>
> yaml
>
> Copy code
>
> \- name: Use Node.js 12.x
>
> uses: actions/setup-node@v1
>
> with:
>
> node-version: \'12.x\'
>
> Unnecessary steps: The workflow file includes unnecessary steps that do not contribute to the build or tests, causing the workflow to run slower than necessary. For example, if the workflow includes multiple steps to set up the same tool, these steps can be consolidated into one.
>
> Example from patch:
>
> arduino
>
> Copy code
>
> \- name: Install chromium prerequisites
>
> if: runner.os == \'Linux\'
>
> run: \|
>
> sudo apt-get update
>
> sudo apt-get install libgbm-dev
>
> Incorrect syntax: The workflow file contains incorrect syntax or typos, causing the workflow to fail. For example, if a step is missing a colon or quotation mark, the workflow will not run correctly.
>
> Example from patch:
>
> bash
>
> Copy code
>
> \- name: ansible user
>
> run: docker-compose exec -T \${{matrix.build-os}} sudo -u ansible sudo -v
>
> Incorrect workflow event: The workflow file is triggered by the wrong event or does not include the necessary event, causing the workflow to not run at all. For example, if the workflow is intended to run on push events, but is triggered by pull request events, the workflow will not run correctly.
>
> Example from patch:
>
> yaml
>
> Copy code
>
> on:
>
> push:
>
> branches: \[ master \]
>
> pull_request:
>
> branches: \[ master \]
>
> Incorrect workflow condition: The workflow file includes incorrect or unnecessary conditions that prevent the workflow from running. For example, if a step is conditional on an environment variable that is not set or is set to the wrong value, the step will not run.
>
> Example from patch:
>
> arduino
>
> Copy code
>
> \- name: Install dependencies
>
> if: matrix.os == \'ubuntu-latest\'
>
> run: \|
>
> sudo apt-get update
>
> sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
>
> sudo apt-get install -y npm

> Regarding the GitHub Actions documentation, to prevent bugs in the provided text, authors should make sure to include clear and detailed instructions on how to set up the necessary tools and dependencies, and provide examples of correctly formatted workflow files. They should also include instructions on how to troubleshoot common issues that may arise during the build or testing process.

\### Addressing Various Workflow Issues

These scenarios provide readers with practical challenges that they might face in real-world CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. The examples intentionally contain common pitfalls like outdated dependencies, incorrect OS settings, path issues, and environmental misconfigurations, which are typical in software development workflows. The solutions aim to guide the reader through the process of identifying and resolving these issues.

To reduce the occurrence of these issues:

1\. \*\*Thoroughly Review Workflow Files\*\*: Before implementing, always validate the syntax and logic of the workflow. There are linters available that can help identify potential problems in GitHub Actions workflow files.

2\. \*\*Stay Updated\*\*: Regularly review and update the versions of actions and tools used in the workflow. This can prevent unexpected failures due to deprecations or changes in these tools.

3\. \*\*Use Templates & Shared Workflows\*\*: If similar workflows are used across multiple projects, consider creating a template or shared workflow. This centralizes the logic and makes it easier to propagate fixes across all projects.

4\. \*\*Monitor & Alert\*\*: Set up monitoring and alerts for the workflows. This ensures that if something goes wrong, the responsible team is notified immediately.

5\. \*\*Document & Educate\*\*: Ensure that there\'s proper documentation on the setup and logic of the workflows. Educate team members on best practices for GitHub Actions, which can reduce the chance of introducing errors.
