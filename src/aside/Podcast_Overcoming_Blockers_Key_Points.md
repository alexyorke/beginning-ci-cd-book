## **Key Points from Continuous Delivery Podcast: Overcoming Blockers** {#key-points-from-continuous-delivery-podcast-overcoming-blockers .unnumbered}

This episode discusses common obstacles to achieving Continuous Delivery and offers solutions:

**Problems:**

- **Penetration Testing as a Bottleneck:** Expensive external pen-testing done in large batches slows down frequent deployments.

- **Bureaucracy in Tool Acquisition:** Lengthy procurement processes for essential tools delay Continuous Delivery initiatives by months.

- **Fear and Perceived Lack of Freedom:** Blame culture and the perception that individuals can't effect change stifle innovation and experimentation.

- **Outdated Policies:** Rigid policies, like code freezes or mandatory handoffs, create waste and hinder agility.

- **Lack of Slack:** Overbooked schedules and a lack of breathing room prevent teams from experimenting and improving processes.

**Solutions:**

- **Challenge Assumptions and Policies:** Question the necessity of policies like blanket pen-testing for every change.

- **Focus on Education and Collaboration:** Empower developers with security knowledge and work with operations teams to automate deployments.

- **Start Small with Experiments:** Find a low-risk area to pilot new practices and build trust with stakeholders.

- **Iterative Improvement and Automation:** Gradually automate processes and policies to reduce manual work and increase efficiency.

- **Leadership Buy-In and Evangelization:** Secure leadership support to champion Continuous Delivery and overcome organizational resistance.

- **Build Trust Through Collaboration:** Involve operations teams early in the development process and work together to create robust deployment practices.

- **Emphasize the Importance of Slack:** Advocate for dedicated time to experiment, learn, and improve processes, ultimately paving the way for Continuous Delivery.

**Overall Conclusion:**

While technical challenges exist, the most significant roadblocks to Continuous Delivery are often rooted in organizational culture, outdated policies, and a lack of slack. Overcoming these obstacles requires a shift in mindset, open communication, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
