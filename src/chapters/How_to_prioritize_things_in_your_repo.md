# How to prioritize things in your repo

Prioritization is key:

- Focus on high-impact tasks like fixing critical Dependabot alerts, updating the base image, and addressing performance bottlenecks in your pipeline.

- Delegate or automate low-priority tasks like removing inactive user accounts, linting, and code formatting.

Proactive maintenance:

- Subscribe to GitHub's Deprecation Archives and Changelog to stay ahead of breaking changes.

- Regularly review and consolidate workarounds in your scripts for efficiency.

- Maintain a stable, modular application with good code health and test coverage.

Dependency management:

- Understand the risks and benefits of upgrading transitive dependencies.

- Choose a strategy for updating dependencies (always latest or pinned versions).

- Consider using the latest packages for security fixes, balancing reproducibility.

Workflow optimization:

- Expect to revise your workflow as dependencies evolve.

- Use caching, branch/file ignores, and selective test disabling for efficiency.

- Analyze historical PR comments to identify recurring issues and proactively address them.

Remember: Automate what you can, delegate when possible, and always prioritize tasks for maximum impact.

Determining the "top 5" most useful patterns from the "Busy Person Patterns" can vary based on individual needs and contexts. However, commonly encountered scenarios in busy schedules might make the following patterns particularly valuable: warning this is creative commons licensed

Prioritize: This is fundamental for effective time management. By prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance, you can ensure that the most critical tasks are addressed first, which is crucial in a busy schedule.

Just Start: Procrastination can be a significant barrier to productivity. This pattern encourages starting a task, even with incomplete information, which can be particularly useful in overcoming initial inertia and making progress.

Contiguous Time Blocks: In an era of constant interruptions, dedicating uninterrupted time to a task can significantly improve focus and efficiency, especially for complex or demanding tasks.

Delegate: This pattern is key in workload management, especially for those in leadership roles or working within teams. Delegating tasks effectively can help manage your workload and also empower others by entrusting them with responsibilities.

Batch the Simple Stuff: By grouping similar small tasks, you can handle them more efficiently, freeing up time for more significant tasks. This pattern is particularly useful for managing the multitude of minor tasks that can otherwise fragment your day.
