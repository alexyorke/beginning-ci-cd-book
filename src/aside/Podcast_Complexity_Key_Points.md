## **Key Points from the Continuous Delivery Podcast: Complexity** {#key-points-from-the-continuous-delivery-podcast-complexity .unnumbered}

This episode explores complexity in software development from various angles.

**What is complexity?**

- **Difficulty in completion:** Many dependencies, unreachable stakeholders, and external factors contribute to complexity.

- **Unpredictability:** Inability to foresee how changes will impact the system.

- **Effort disproportionate to change:** Simple changes requiring extensive coordination and effort.

- **Codebase intricacy:** Difficulty understanding code structure, duplication, and fear of unintended consequences.

**Causes of complexity:**

- **Technical debt and legacy code:** Messy, poorly architected codebases.

- **Overly complex frameworks:** Using "one size fits all" solutions that introduce unnecessary dependencies.

- **Designing for unknown future:** Building features for anticipated needs instead of focusing on current requirements.

- **Organizational structure:** Conway's Law - system complexity mirrors organizational complexity. Poorly architected systems reflecting organizational changes.

**Combating complexity:**

- **Merciless refactoring:** Continuously simplify code, keeping methods and classes small.

- **True DevOps adoption:** Empowering developers to build automation and simplify workflows and environments.

- **Tight feedback loops:** Short planning cycles with frequent feedback from product and end-users.

**Identifying and tracking complexity:**

- **Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, and other static code analysis tools.**

- **Time to implement changes:** Increasing time indicates growing complexity.

- **Throughput measurement:** Low throughput can be a symptom of a complex system.

- **Number of code changes to fix a bug:** Multiple changes for a single bug suggest a complex system.

**Other important points:**

- **Cynefin framework:** A model for understanding and addressing complexity based on the nature of the problem.

- **Stacy complexity matrix:** Applying the Cynefin framework to system design.

- **Complexity impacts the entire organization:** From development teams to organizational structure.
