Thanks for reviewing my book!

What I am looking for:

- Sections that should be removed (have no relevance to the book at all), added, or are debatable (provide a case study or references).
- What sections you'd like me to write more about, what sections are neutral, and what sections are boring.
- High-level overview of any organization changes (e.g., rearranging the sections in the table of contents).
- Technical inaccuracies (when possible).
- Changing the table of contents to better align with the audience.
- Whether you would recommend this book to your friends (I promise I wonâ€™t hold you to it).
- Whether the current table of contents may be sufficient to meet the page count goal, or I may need to write more about other sections.

What I am not looking for as much:

- Spelling, grammar, or formatting, unless formatting makes the text unreadable.
- Nit-picks.
