## **Key Points from the Continuous Delivery Podcast: Complexity**

This episode explores complexity in software development from various angles.

**What is complexity?**

- **Difficulty in completion:** Many dependencies, unreachable stakeholders, and external factors contribute to complexity.

- **Unpredictability:** Inability to foresee how changes will impact the system.

- **Effort disproportionate to change:** Simple changes requiring extensive coordination and effort.

- **Codebase intricacy:** Difficulty understanding code structure, duplication, and fear of unintended consequences.

**Causes of complexity:**

- **Technical debt and legacy code:** Messy, poorly architected codebases.

- **Overly complex frameworks:** Using "one size fits all" solutions that introduce unnecessary dependencies.

- **Designing for unknown future:** Building features for anticipated needs instead of focusing on current requirements.

- **Organizational structure:** Conway's Law - system complexity mirrors organizational complexity. Poorly architected systems reflecting organizational changes.

**Combating complexity:**

- **Merciless refactoring:** Continuously simplify code, keeping methods and classes small.

- **True DevOps adoption:** Empowering developers to build automation and simplify workflows and environments.

- **Tight feedback loops:** Short planning cycles with frequent feedback from product and end-users.

**Identifying and tracking complexity:**

- **Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, and other static code analysis tools.**

- **Time to implement changes:** Increasing time indicates growing complexity.

- **Throughput measurement:** Low throughput can be a symptom of a complex system.

- **Number of code changes to fix a bug:** Multiple changes for a single bug suggest a complex system.

**Other important points:**

- **Cynefin framework:** A model for understanding and addressing complexity based on the nature of the problem.

- **Stacy complexity matrix:** Applying the Cynefin framework to system design.

- **Complexity impacts the entire organization:** From development teams to organizational structure.

## **Key Points from Continuous Delivery Podcast: Overcoming Blockers**

This episode discusses common obstacles to achieving Continuous Delivery and offers solutions:

**Problems:**

- **Penetration Testing as a Bottleneck:** Expensive external pen-testing done in large batches slows down frequent deployments.

- **Bureaucracy in Tool Acquisition:** Lengthy procurement processes for essential tools delay Continuous Delivery initiatives by months.

- **Fear and Perceived Lack of Freedom:** Blame culture and the perception that individuals can't effect change stifle innovation and experimentation.

- **Outdated Policies:** Rigid policies, like code freezes or mandatory handoffs, create waste and hinder agility.

- **Lack of Slack:** Overbooked schedules and a lack of breathing room prevent teams from experimenting and improving processes.

**Solutions:**

- **Challenge Assumptions and Policies:** Question the necessity of policies like blanket pen-testing for every change.

- **Focus on Education and Collaboration:** Empower developers with security knowledge and work with operations teams to automate deployments.

- **Start Small with Experiments:** Find a low-risk area to pilot new practices and build trust with stakeholders.

- **Iterative Improvement and Automation:** Gradually automate processes and policies to reduce manual work and increase efficiency.

- **Leadership Buy-In and Evangelization:** Secure leadership support to champion Continuous Delivery and overcome organizational resistance.

- **Build Trust Through Collaboration:** Involve operations teams early in the development process and work together to create robust deployment practices.

- **Emphasize the Importance of Slack:** Advocate for dedicated time to experiment, learn, and improve processes, ultimately paving the way for Continuous Delivery.

**Overall Conclusion:**

While technical challenges exist, the most significant roadblocks to Continuous Delivery are often rooted in organizational culture, outdated policies, and a lack of slack. Overcoming these obstacles requires a shift in mindset, open communication, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
