# Common Questions

This chapter answers frequently asked questions related to CI/CD concepts covered in this book.

Okay, let's filter the questions relevant to a CI/CD book and group them into themes.

**Filtering Rationale:**

- **Keep:** Questions about CI/CD concepts, principles, practices, workflows, pipeline configuration (YAML, scripting), tool integrations (source control, build tools, testing tools, security tools, artifact repositories, deployment targets like servers, cloud services, K8s), environment management, secrets handling, deployment strategies, branching strategies, runner/agent configuration, troubleshooting common pipeline issues, security considerations within CI/CD, comparisons between tools/approaches.
- **Discard:** Questions specific to course logistics (links, notes, prerequisites, cost, presenter's tools/voice/personal info, comparison to other courses), overly specific debugging help tied to a video timestamp without generalizable principles, career advice, requests for unrelated tutorials (unless it's a direct CI/CD integration like Terraform/Ansible), feedback on presentation style, basic Git/tool usage outside the CI/CD context, platform account issues (like billing or validation).
