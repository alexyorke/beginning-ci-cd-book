### Configuring build tools {#configuring-build-tools .unnumbered}

#### Setting up the build tool with the appropriate configuration file(s) {#setting-up-the-build-tool-with-the-appropriate-configuration-files .unnumbered}

-   How do I force other developers to use extensions in the IDE? Workspaces, etc. You can do so implicitly by forcing these checks on the CI server, such as linting. It should have the same configuration as the ones that developers have. Therefore, developers will be inclined to use the recommended extensions because that way they won't have to redo a commit or a formatting change.

-   IDE extensions such as linting on save/format, particular rules, etc.

-   The testing commands won't work (usually) if you don't have any tests. It's advisable to write some more using CI/CD, or at least writing a single test, to show that the test build step can block the build if it fails.

-   Try to run these commands on your local computer and see if they work (via the command line) outside of your IDE. This is because our IDE might have certain software pre-installed to make it easier for development (or different environment variables set), but this could make things more complex. If they work, then you're on the right track.

-   git commit hooks? Might be too advanced, unsure.

#### Defining the build lifecycle, including phases and goals {#defining-the-build-lifecycle-including-phases-and-goals .unnumbered}

-   When you're building it, make sure that the runner's OS matches the ones that you're developing on. This is important because testing is done on the build machines, thus, if you build it on a different OS it is possible for idiosyncrasies. If you are using multiple OSes, do a matrix build, but don't use the artifacts from the other build steps (just test them.) Instead, just deploy the artifacts that are targeted for the destination OS. The latter part is optional but provides a baseline level of assurance that the tests/compile passes on the systems where it is being developed.

#### Getting better control on your dependencies, and lock files {#getting-better-control-on-your-dependencies-and-lock-files .unnumbered}

-   Lock files are a way to control your dependencies at a specific version, including any of its dependencies. Its goal is to make a reproducible build environment. The lock files are required because, even if you run the same commands in the same environment on non-dependency locked files, it's possible that it might use the latest or a different version of the dependency, depending on whatever dependency satisfies the one in the manifest and is in the artifact repository on the remote.

-   You might already have a lockfile. If not, I would recommend that you create one. This is how you do it in the popular programming languages:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sure, I\'ll provide instructions on how to utilize the lock files during the installation process for the respective programming languages:                                                                               |

### Code Review {#code-review .unnumbered}

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code Review (in the context of CI/CD):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| A code review in the context of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is the systematic examination of source code changes by one or more individuals other than the original author, before those changes are merged into the main codebase or deployed to production. |

-   Code review also provides the capability for other developers to find bugs, and to become more familiar with the changes occurring in the repository so that they can see how their integrations will fit in. [[IEEE Paper Template in A4 (V1) (microsoft.com)]{.underline}](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/PID3556473.pdf) and [[output.pdf (microsoft.com)]{.underline}](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bosu2015useful.pdf) and Code review quality. Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering - ICSE '16 \| 10.1145/2884781.2884840

-   Code review is a critical part of CI/CD, because they are a gatekeeper to prevent buggy code from reaching production, and can also provide opportunities for developers to provide higher-order ideas, such as usability, security, and design guidance. Therefore, it can help increase code quality, and provides opportunities for senior developers to help junior developers.

-   During code review, other developer(s) will look at these changes and verify that they are correct. The reviewers will then comment on a specific line or lines in the PR, and add comments.

-   Some general themes for code review are:

    -   Knowledge transfer. Having other people review the code allows them to be kept up-to-date on what is changing.

    -   Finding bugs. For example, if a certain set of inputs would cause an undesirable output.

    -   Design. For example, certain programming patterns.

    -   Verifying scope. For example, if a PR is changing something that wasn't supposed to be changed, then this should be identified in the code review.

    -   Security. For example, a certain set of input(s) into a function, or a certain system state would cause secret data to be leaked, access granted to the wrong person, authorization issues, etc

-   These steps help increase code quality, and prevent bugs from reaching production. Normally, there is a bit of back-and-forth when a developer comments on a task. Sometimes, developers might discuss an issue, especially if there isn't a single best solution.

-   Developers might do many nitpicks in the review. Nitpicks are defined as spacing issues, or small, 1-3 character changes that do not affect functionality. It is important that these issues are identified during CR (code review) because overall they help make the code more consistent and easier to read. The nitpicks are not necessarily bad in and of themselves, rather, there should be tooling set up to make sure that as many nitpicks are automatically fixed before the PR process (i.e., linters.) This can automatically format the code, and make it easier for other developers to work on it. This is because code intending (or lack thereof) can decrease code comprehension and can make resolving merge conflicts more difficult.

-   Or, if there are many, many comments on the PR, it might be more efficient to talk to the author of the PR instead. This is because there might be a misunderstanding about the PR. However, having written records is important, as other developers on the team can read the others reviews, and therefore learn about how to write better code in the future, including company policies. It can also be aggregated to find common issues, such as nitpicks, and can provide managers with a better understanding about how to improve their team.

-   In addition to its communication advantages, it also has some softer advantages. For example, it allows teammates to develop a professional relationship, as trust can be established between teammates.

| Certainly, here are the key points extracted from the text, tailored for a chapter or section on code review in a book about beginning CI/CD:                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1\. \*\*Review Duration\*\*: Effectiveness in spotting defects during code reviews drops significantly after one hour. It\'s recommended to review for at most one hour at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2\. \*\*Review Depth\*\*: Slowing down code readings increases the number of defects detected. The time spent in review is a dominant factor in defect detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3\. \*\*Meeting Format\*\*: Traditional in-person, moderator-directed inspection meetings aren\'t always necessary. A lot of defects are identified in the pre-meeting reading phase. Meetings can be effective for identifying false positives and for knowledge transfer. Remote meetings or electronic communications (e.g., emails) can be just as effective. |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4\. \*\*Defect Metrics\*\*: Using defects per line of code (kLOC) as a metric is unreliable. The number of defects per kLOC varies greatly across different studies and projects.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5\. \*\*Omission Defects\*\*: One of the toughest defects to catch are omissions or things that are missing in the code. Checklists can be helpful in reminding reviewers to look for potentially missing elements.                                                                                                                                               |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 6\. \*\*Statistical Significance\*\*: Many studies on code reviews are too small to be statistically significant by themselves. However, when considered collectively, they can provide valuable insights.                                                                                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7\. \*\*Importance of Checklists\*\*: Using checklists during code reviews can help in ensuring that important aspects are not overlooked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Given that this is for a CI/CD-focused book, you might also emphasize how automated testing and continuous integration can complement manual code reviews, catching different types of errors and improving the overall software quality.                                                                                                                         |

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 1\. \*\*Importance of Different Perspectives\*\*: One\'s own code may look fine when reviewed by oneself, but external reviewers can spot issues more effectively. It\'s beneficial to view code in a different format or environment than the usual editor.                                                                                                      |

#### How big should my PRs be? {#how-big-should-my-prs-be .unnumbered}

-   A common recommendation is for PRs to be concise and focused. However, this doesn\'t mean they should be trivial; instead, they should encapsulate a singular, coherent change or improvement. While it is unlikely that it will compile due to the syntax of programs, this doesn't allow for code review. It's too small to understand the intent or context of this change. It would also create a very large overhead if one had to document each character change. It also wouldn't be possible to have a meaningful discussion on the ramifications of the changes. Once sufficient changes have been added, it might be difficult to piece together the context from previous changes to understand how this change is related to the other ones.

-   It is also difficult to revert the change. For example, say a new change caused a bug. Which part of the many PRs do you revert? They will be mixed in with the other changes, so it is difficult to remove it.

-   Therefore, even if you are creating something that isn't visible to users, there should be a way to test it, either by automated tests or by modifying the code (feature flags are preferable.) It doesn't have to be completed, and it might have errors if used in a certain way, but the overall framework or possibility of using or evaluating what context that thing that you're creating in should be apparent. This might include scaffolding, etc.

#### On pair programming {#on-pair-programming .unnumbered}

-   Pair programming is a practice where usually two people (sometimes more) work together in real-time on a programming project, normally in a single editor on one person's screen. The advantages to pair programming is to allow people to actively communicate their ideas while coding, potentially causing synergy (where two people working together have more efforts combined than if they were working alone, combined.) This is especially advantageous if one person, such as a senior, is paired with a junior programmer, or someone who is unfamiliar with the project. This allows the person who is unfamiliar with the project to have a fast learning feedback loop: the unfamiliar person can ask questions and receive answers in nearly real-time (well, however fast the other person responds.) This is a very high-bandwidth communication channel, allowing for information and ideas to flow freely.

-   Pair programming was initially popularized in XP (extreme programming) (verify this), where integration time was correlated to how long people pair programmed for. This was one of the earliest introductions to "integration hell", thus, encouraging people to integrate their work more frequently (verify this.)

-   This is similar to code review, but involves two people working together in real-time. Code review can occur during pair programming, but this term is commonly used for async code reviews, where someone leaves comments on a PR (and then they respond to it async.)

**Note: some projects are not "compiled" in the traditional sense (i.e., interpreted), so they don't necessarily generate output files (for example, Python.)**

| Python applications can be packaged in different ways. If you want for other people to consume it then the instructions are pretty straightforward and standardized. If you want to publish it to a server, it depends. ChatGPT says this is a common project layout but I can't really verify it, it doesn't look like there are standard Python project layouts. |

| Always remember to exclude the \`/target\` or \`/build\` directories from version control since these contain compiled bytecode and other artifacts. Instead, rely on the build tool (Maven, Gradle) to produce these during the CI/CD process.                                                                                                                    |

#### Deployment and Release Strategies {#deployment-and-release-strategies-1 .unnumbered}

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Certainly! Deployment strategies dictate how new versions of an application are rolled out to users and environments. Here are five top deployment strategies commonly used in CI/CD:                                                                                                                                 |

| \- \*\*Description:\*\* This strategy involves having two separate environments: Blue (current production) and Green (new version). When deploying, the new version is released to the Green environment. Once tested and ready, traffic is switched from Blue to Green, making Green the new production environment. |

| \- \*\*Advantages:\*\* Enables quick rollback, reduces downtime, and allows for thorough testing before release.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| \- \*\*Disadvantages:\*\* Requires duplicated environments, which can be resource-intensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 2\. \*\*Canary Deployment:\*\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| \- \*\*Description:\*\* Instead of releasing the new version to all users at once, it\'s rolled out gradually to a subset of users (the \"canaries\"). Monitoring tools track the application\'s performance and user feedback. If everything looks good, the new version is gradually rolled out to more users.      |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| \- \*\*Advantages:\*\* Reduces the risk by testing the new release on a subset of users, allowing for early detection of issues.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| \- \*\*Disadvantages:\*\* Requires sophisticated routing and monitoring infrastructure. Can complicate troubleshooting due to having multiple versions running concurrently.                                                                                                                                          |

| \- \*\*Description:\*\* The new version is rolled out incrementally, replacing instances of the old version. This continues until all instances run the new version.                                                                                                                                                  |

| \- \*\*Advantages:\*\* Simplifies deployment process and infrastructure. Does not require double the environment as in Blue-Green.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| \- \*\*Disadvantages:\*\* A period exists where different versions are running simultaneously, which can lead to inconsistencies. If issues arise, rollback might be more complex.                                                                                                                                    |

| \- \*\*Description:\*\* Instead of managing releases through deployments, features are released behind flags or toggles. This allows teams to deploy code to production but hide the new feature\'s functionality until it\'s ready to be released to users.                                                          |

| \- \*\*Advantages:\*\* Provides more granular control over features, allows for A/B testing, and can be used to quickly roll back a feature without redeploying.                                                                                                                                                      |

| \- \*\*Disadvantages:\*\* Can complicate the codebase with multiple toggle checks. Requires effective management of toggles to avoid \"stale\" flags.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| \- \*\*Description:\*\* The new version is deployed alongside the old version in the production environment, but no real users are directed to it. Instead, real user traffic is mirrored to the new version to simulate real-world usage, but the new version\'s responses are discarded and not seen by real users. |

| \- \*\*Disadvantages:\*\* Can be resource-intensive as it duplicates traffic. Requires advanced infrastructure to mirror and manage traffic.                                                                                                                                                                          |

| The best strategy often depends on the specific application, infrastructure, team capabilities, and the criticality of the release. It\'s also worth noting that many organizations use a combination of these strategies based on their needs.                                                                       |
