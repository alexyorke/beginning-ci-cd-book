Okay, here are the consolidated and rephrased questions, grouped by topic, as if asked by a single person learning Docker and CI/CD concepts. Frequencies are estimated based on the provided list.

**Fundamentals & Concepts:**

1.  I'm still really confused about what Docker actually _is_ and _why_ I should use it. How is it different from just running my code directly or using a virtual machine? What problems does it solve, especially for solo projects or simple web apps? Is it like a lightweight VM, or something else entirely? (Frequency: ~35+)
2.  What's the real difference between a Docker image and a container? Is the image just the blueprint and the container the running instance? (Frequency: ~5)
3.  I hear "container orchestration" mentioned a lot with Docker, especially Kubernetes. What does orchestration actually mean in this context, and why is it needed? (Frequency: ~5)
4.  What's the practical difference between stopping a container and removing it? When should I do each? (Frequency: ~3)
5.  How does Docker handle resources? If I run multiple containers, will they crash my server if they use too much memory or CPU? How are resources allocated? (Frequency: ~3)
6.  How secure are Docker containers? If they share the host OS kernel, could a virus in one container affect others or the host? What about running scripts inside – is that safe? How can I trust third-party images from Docker Hub? (Frequency: ~8)
7.  What's the difference between the Docker client, the Docker daemon, and the Docker engine? Are they all separate things I need to install or understand? (Frequency: ~3)
8.  Is Docker still relevant today, especially with tools like Kubernetes or alternatives like Podman? Is it deprecated or being replaced? (Frequency: ~5)

**Dockerfile & Images:**

9.  I need a solid explanation of the `Dockerfile`. What are the essential commands (like `FROM`, `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, `WORKDIR`, `EXPOSE`, `ARG`, `ENV`), what do they do, and when should I use each one? What's the difference between `RUN`, `CMD`, and `ENTRYPOINT`? (Frequency: ~30+)
10. How do I choose the right base image (`FROM`)? Does it matter if I use `ubuntu`, `alpine`, `node`, `python`, or a `slim` version? What are the implications for size and functionality? Does the base image OS need to match my host OS? (Frequency: ~15+)
11. My Docker images seem really large. How can I make them smaller? What are multi-stage builds and distroless images, and how do they help reduce size? Does building _inside_ the Dockerfile (multi-stage) make sense compared to copying pre-built artifacts? (Frequency: ~15+)
12. How does Docker's build cache work? Why do some commands run every time even if the files haven't changed? How does the order of commands affect caching, especially `COPY package.json` vs `COPY . .`? When should I use `--no-cache`? (Frequency: ~10+)
13. What actually goes _inside_ a Docker image? Does it contain a full OS, just my application code, dependencies, or some combination? How can I inspect the layers or contents of an image? Can I hide my source code inside it? (Frequency: ~10+)
14. How should I manage image tags? What does `:latest` really mean, and is it bad practice to use it? How do I update images or tag them for different environments (dev, prod)? (Frequency: ~10+)
15. How do I handle application dependencies (like Python's `requirements.txt` or Node's `package.json`) in a Dockerfile? Do I still need tools like `venv` or `conda` inside the container? Why copy the manifest file (`package.json`) separately before copying the rest of the code? Should I include `node_modules` or lock files (`package-lock.json`)? (Frequency: ~10+)
16. What's the build context (`.` in `docker build .`) and how does it relate to the `COPY` command paths and `.dockerignore`? (Frequency: ~5+)
17. How do I pass arguments or environment variables during the build (`ARG` vs `ENV`) versus setting environment variables for the running container (`ENV`)? (Frequency: ~4)

**Volumes & Data Persistence:**

18. How do I save data permanently in Docker? My container data disappears when I remove the container. What are volumes and bind mounts, what's the difference, and when should I use each? (Frequency: ~50+)
19. How do volumes actually work? Where are they stored on my host machine? Can I see their contents, manage their size, back them up, or delete them when I'm done? Do they have size limits? (Frequency: ~20+)
20. I'm having trouble with file permissions when using volumes or bind mounts, especially when the container runs as non-root but needs to write to a host directory owned by root. How do I fix this? (Frequency: ~5+)
21. Can I share the same volume or bind mount between multiple containers? How does that work for reading and writing data concurrently? (Frequency: ~10+)
22. How do volumes work with Docker Compose? Do I define them in the `docker-compose.yml` file? Can I specify a local path (like on my Windows drive) for a volume in the compose file? Does Compose create volumes automatically? (Frequency: ~10+)
23. What happens to data in volumes if I restart the container, update the image, or upgrade the Docker engine? (Frequency: ~5)
24. Can I mount a specific file instead of a whole directory as a volume? (Frequency: ~3)

**Networking:**

25. How do Docker containers communicate with each other? Do they get their own IP addresses? How can I make my web container talk to my database container? (Frequency: ~15+)
26. What's the deal with port mapping (`-p host:container`)? How do I choose ports? Can I map multiple ports? Can I access the container's service from another computer on my network or only from `localhost`? (Frequency: ~15+)
27. How can my container access services running on my host machine (like a local API or database), especially `localhost`? Does this work differently on Windows/Mac vs. Linux? (Frequency: ~6)
28. What are the different Docker network drivers (bridge, host, overlay, macvlan, none)? When should I use each one? What does the default bridge network (`docker0`) do? (Frequency: ~10+)
29. How can I set up more complex networking, like exposing multiple containerized websites using different domain names on the same host, possibly using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik? (Frequency: ~5)
30. How does Docker networking interact with volumes or container lifecycles? (Frequency: ~2)

**Docker Compose:**

31. Why do I need Docker Compose? Isn't it just a way to run multiple `docker run` commands? How is it different from just using Dockerfiles or a multi-stage build? (Frequency: ~10+)
32. How do I write a `docker-compose.yml` file? What are the basic sections like `services`, `volumes`, `networks`, `ports`, `environment`, `build`, `context`? Does the order matter? Does the `version` tag still matter? (Frequency: ~10+)
33. How do services defined in the same Docker Compose file talk to each other? Do I use service names? Do I need `links` anymore? (Frequency: ~5)
34. How do I manage the lifecycle with Compose? How do I start, stop, restart, rebuild, and view logs for my services? How do I make services start automatically when my server boots? (Frequency: ~5+)
35. Can I use Docker Compose in production, or is it just for development? How do I deploy a Compose application? (Frequency: ~4)

**Installation, Setup & Environment:**

42. What are the typical hardware requirements for running Docker (RAM, CPU)? (Frequency: ~3)

**Development Workflow & Integration:**

43. How does Docker change my local development workflow? How do I handle code changes – do I need to rebuild the image every time? How does hot reloading (like with nodemon or Vite HMR) work with volumes/bind mounts? (Frequency: ~25+)
44. I'm having issues getting hot reloading/live code sync to work, especially on Windows or Mac. Changes in my local files aren't showing up in the container. What could be wrong? (Frequency: ~15+)
