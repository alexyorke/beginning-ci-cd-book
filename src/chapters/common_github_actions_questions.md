Okay, here is a refined list of questions about GitHub Actions, grouped by low-level concepts suitable for a beginner's guide. The questions have been made more uniform in tone, as if asked by a single learner seeking clarification.

**1. Fundamentals & Core Concepts**
_ How do I enable or find the Actions tab in my GitHub repository or account settings?
_ What is the required naming convention and location for workflow files (e.g., `.yml` files) within the `.github` directory?
_ What are the prerequisites, like knowledge of YAML, needed to start writing GitHub Actions workflows?
_ What are the core concepts of GitHub Actions, including workflows, jobs, steps, and actions themselves?
_ Where do GitHub Actions workflows actually execute? Is it on GitHub servers, AWS, or somewhere else?

_ What does the `github.action_path` context variable represent within a workflow?
_ Is the `actions/checkout@v2` step always necessary at the beginning of a job, or are there cases where it can be omitted?
_ Can you clarify the difference between a GitHub Actions "workflow" and an "action"?
_ What defines a "CI/CD pipeline" in the context of GitHub Actions, versus just a simple workflow?

_ Do workflows triggered by `push` events run if the push originates from a local merge without a corresponding Pull Request on GitHub?
_ Can a workflow be automatically triggered when a new repository is created within an organization?
